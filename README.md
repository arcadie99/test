# Simple autoloader integration in project


# Autoloading
In computer programming, autoloading is the capability of loading and linking portions of a program from mass storage automatically when needed, so that the programmer is not required to define or include those portions of the program explicitly. Many high-level programming languages include autoload capabilities, which sacrifice some run-time speed for ease of coding and speed of initial compilation/linking. 

# Composer
Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you


## comand to update the autoloader files
```
composer dump-autoload
```
